# NonIntersectingLinesDrawer
The application draws continuous, non-intersecting lines between two points selected by the user. 

Example:
 - User clicks at two points
 - A line is drawn between the two points
 - User clicks at two new points
 - A new line is drawn which does not intercept the previous line
 - And so on for any number of lines...
